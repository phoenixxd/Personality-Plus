# Personality-Plus
This is to ease the quiz given in the starting of the book, Personality Plus by Florence Littauer. All the content and text used belongs solely to the author, writer or publications of the book.

To definition of the option can be found by swiping right. Pressing back button will take you back to the previous option you selected you can change it. Note that once you go back when you come back the remaining options would be randomised so you may not get the same option right away which you were looking before. 
Let me know if you find any bugs :)
